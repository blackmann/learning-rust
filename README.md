# learning-rust 🦀

This is my attempt to learn rust by Googling 🔍 the hell out of it while I develop the projects in this repo. I have
gathered some basic knowledge using the IntelliJ EduTools course on Rust. I haven't completed it yet, but I'm tired of
just learning syntax and semantics.

| 25 January 2022 | Started work on a todo list command-line app. Implemented printing the usage.                                                                                          |
| 26 January 2022 | Refactored to use `clap` for handling argument parsing. Clap comes along with some nice batteries                                                                      |
| 28 January 2022 | I didn't skip a night. Just happened to finish up at this time. 12:33 AM. I'm getting a hang of rust. It's cool. I'm able to get through documentations for libraries. |
| 29 January 2022 | I could figure out "move" and I roamed the whole internet                                                                                                              |
| 30 January 2022 | I came out victorious. I have it figured by trying to read the docs again and listening to the compiler.                                                               |
